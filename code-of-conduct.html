       <h1><strong>Hanford High School Programming Club Code of Conduct</strong></h1>
       <h3><strong>Version 1.0</strong> by Jack Spencer</h3>

       <h2><strong>Abbreviations:</strong></h2>
       <li>HCC: Hanford High School Programming Club</li>
       <li>CC: Code of Conduct</li>
       <li>HC: Hack Club</li>

       <h2><Strong>Preamble</Strong></h2>
       <p>The Hanford High School Programming Club (HCC) aims to create an inclusive learning environment for all students interested in computer science, regardless of experience level. We are committed to treating each other with respect, kindness, and equity. There is zero tolerance for rudeness, bullying, or discrimination within HCC.</p>

       <h2><strong>Club Activities</strong></h2>
       <p>HCC meets every Wednesday after school from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM. Meetings will only be canceled if the Club President (Jack Spencer), Club Vice President (Sergio Almanza), or Club Teacher Advisor (Eric Ogden) is unavailable.</p>
       <p>Activities include workshops provided by Hack Club (HC), such as Blot, Sprig, Onboard, The Bin, and Jams. Members may also organize presentations, collaborate on projects, and engage in other computer science-related activities.</p>
       <p>Members are expected to manage their own projects using Git or similar version control systems. All code must be open source to receive support from HC, and projects should be hosted on GitHub with an open source license (e.g., MIT, GPL, or the Carbonated License created for the club).</p>

       <h2><strong>Membership</strong></h2>
       <p>To join HCC, members must maintain a GPA of at least 2.0 and demonstrate active participation in their classes. We strive to foster a positive and safe environment free from hate and discrimination. Violations of this principle may result in removal from HCC.</p>
       <p>Additionally, HCC is committed to ethical programming practices. Members are prohibited from creating malware, harmful software, spyware, or any other unethical projects. We encourage all members to contribute to a safe and positive digital landscape.</p>
